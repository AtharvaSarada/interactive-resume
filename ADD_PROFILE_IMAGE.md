## üîÑ If You Used a Different Filename

1. Open: `src/components/ProfileCard.jsx`

2. Find line 68 (the image source):
   ```jsx
   src="/images/profile.jpg"
   ```

3. Change to your filename:
   ```jsx
   src="/images/atharva.jpg"
   ```

4. Save the file

## ‚úÖ Testing Your Image

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Scroll to About section:**
   - You should see your profile photo in the card
   - Photo should have a cyan/blue glowing border
   - Should be circular shape

4. **Test hover effect:**
   - Hover over the image
   - Should slightly enlarge (scale 1.05x)

### Problem: Image doesn't show

**Solutions:**
1. Check file path is correct: `public/images/profile.jpg`

3. Ensure image file isn't corrupted (try opening it)
4. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
5. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Problem: Image shows but looks distorted

1. Ensure image is square (1:1 aspect ratio)
2. Resize image to 400x400px or 800x800px
3. Check image isn't stretched in original file

### Problem: Image loads slowly

**Solutions:**
1. Compress image using TinyPNG or Squoosh
2. Reduce file size to under 200KB
3. Use JPG format instead of PNG for photos

### Problem: Fallback emoji shows instead of image

**Solutions:**
1. This means image failed to load

```

### Adjust Image Size
