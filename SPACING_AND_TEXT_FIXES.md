## 🔧 Fix 1: ProfileCard Name/Role Spacing

### Problem:
Name and role were too close together, overlapping visually.

### Solution:

**Before:**
```css
.pc-details p {
    top: -12px;  /* Negative margin pulling it up */
}
```

**After:**
```css
.pc-details p {
    top: 0px;
    margin-top: 12px;  /* Positive spacing between elements */
}
```

### Result:
```
Atharva U. Sarada
                    ← 12px spacing
Web Developer and A.I. Generalist
```

## 🔧 Fix 2: Hero Section Complete Text

### Problem:
Hero section showed "I'm a" with rotating text that didn't display the full title.

### Solution:

**Before:**
```jsx
I'm a [Rotating Text: Full-Stack Developer / AI Specialist / ...]
```

**After:**
```jsx
I'm a Full-Stack Developer & AI Generalist
```

### Changes Made:
- Removed rotating text animation (was cycling through partial titles)
- Added complete static title: "Full-Stack Developer & AI Generalist"
- Added proper wrapping with `flex-wrap` for responsive display
- Added horizontal padding for mobile: `px-4`

---

## 📱 Responsive Spacing

### ProfileCard:

**Desktop:**
- Name to role spacing: 12px

**Tablet:**
- Name to role spacing: 12px

**Mobile:**
- Name to role spacing: 8px (slightly reduced for smaller screens)

### Hero Section:

**All Sizes:**
- Text wraps properly with `flex-wrap`
- "I'm a" and title maintain proper spacing
- Centered with padding on mobile
